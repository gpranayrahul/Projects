## Background

A dedicated Data Science and ML enthusiast with 2+ years in data science and analytics, currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Analytics at Northeastern University, Boston. My academic pursuit is fortified by rich real-world experiences, most notably as a Data Science and Machine Learning Intern and a Data Analyst at Amazon.

At the core, my expertise lies in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and implementing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. My work has exposed me to a plethora of tools, frameworks, and models – from PCA, t-SNE, and various regression models to deep learning tools like TensorFlow, Keras, and LSTMs. This diverse exposure has given me the capability to work on multifaceted projects across domains.

During my tenure at Amazon, I played a crucial role in data pipeline development, A-B testing, and predictive analysis for revenue channels. Additionally, my analytical insight was instrumental in supply chain analysis, where I devised key metrics to identify potential areas of improvement in inventory management.
